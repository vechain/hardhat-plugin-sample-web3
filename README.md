# Sample Hardhat Project using thor

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract and a test for that contract.

First, install the node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

Before running the tests, you need to spin up a local thor instance. Assuming that thor is running on localhost run the sample test on the `Storage.sol` contract.

```bash
npx hardhat test --network vechain
```
