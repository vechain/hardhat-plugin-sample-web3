# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## Sample `hardhat.config.js` with fee delegation

Fee delegation can be configured by providing optional ```delegate``` config which has required ``url`` and optional ``signer`` field. Url needs to point to delegation a valid
delegation service, for example ```https://sponsor-testnet.vechain.energy/by/${projectId}```.
```js
module.exports = {
    solidity: {
        version: "0.8.17",
    },
    networks: {
        vechain: {
            url: "https://testnet.veblocks.net/",
            delegate: {
                url: "${feeDelegationServiceUrl}",
                signer: "${optionalSigner}"
            }
        },
    }
};
```

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
